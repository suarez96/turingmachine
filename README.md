# turingmachine
Turing Machine made in python:
  Reads an input text file, then makes a turing machine with configurations following the input
  The format of the input .txt files is as follows:\n
  states:\n  
  {0,1,...,n}\n
  transitions: format is (current state, input, next state, character to write to tape, direction to move on tape) end line with ;\n
  (cur, input, next, char, dir);(cur, input, next, char, dir);(cur, input, next, char, dir);\n
  start:\n
  <start state number>\n
  accept: \n
  <accept state number>
