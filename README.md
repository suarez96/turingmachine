# turingmachine
Turing Machine made in python:
  Reads an input text file, then makes a turing machine with configurations following the input
  The format of the input .txt files is as follows:<br />
  states:  <br />
  {0,1,...,n}  <br />
  transitions: format is (current state, input, next state, character to write to tape, direction to move on tape) end line with ;<br /> 
  (cur, input, next, char, dir);(cur, input, next, char, dir);(cur, input, next, char, dir);<br />
  start:  <br />
  <start state number>  <br />
  accept:   <br />
  <accept state number><br />
