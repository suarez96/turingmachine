# turingmachine
Turing Machine made in python:
  Reads an input text file, then makes a turing machine with configurations following the input
  The format of the input .txt files is as follows:\n
  states:  
  {0,1,...,n}  
  transitions: format is (current state, input, next state, character to write to tape, direction to move on tape) end line with ;  
  (cur, input, next, char, dir);(cur, input, next, char, dir);(cur, input, next, char, dir);  
  start:  
  <start state number>  
  accept:   
  <accept state number>
